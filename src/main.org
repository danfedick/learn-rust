#+TITLE: Main Rust File:
#+PROPERTY: header-args :tangle ./main.rs


During compilation, Rust will look for a  =main.rs= file

This line will look for a module named =kids=
The module is named after the file in the same directory.

#+begin_src rust
mod kids;
#+end_src
*Note:* /All lines in Rust should end with a semicolon/

This is the main function.
The main function is calling the run function in the kids module located in the =kids.rs=

#+begin_src rust
fn main() {
    kids::run();
}
#+end_src


To Run the code, use the =cargo run= command.  This will compile and run the binary.
